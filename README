estd.h - by Chris French (unclechromedome@gmail.com)

Use simply by

#include "estd.h"

The files here constitute my implementation of the constraints checks mentioned on pg. 716
of The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition.

I borrowed much code from Andrew Sutton's Origin library and repackaged it.
Hence, this code carries with it the MIT license (http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

My code contains some minor additions and some bug fixes. It is organized differently than Origin,
but maintains the same naming conventions.
